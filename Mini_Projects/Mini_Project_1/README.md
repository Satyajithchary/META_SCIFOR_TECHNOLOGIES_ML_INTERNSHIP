# 🌧️ Rainfall Prediction Project

Welcome to the **Rainfall Prediction Project**! This project aims to forecast rainfall using machine learning techniques. Predicting rainfall is crucial for agriculture, disaster management, and water resource planning. Through this project, we aim to leverage historical weather data to build a predictive model for rainfall.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to develop a model that can accurately predict rainfall based on various meteorological factors. The project involves data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of the results.

### Key Features:

- **Data Collection:** Utilized historical weather data to train the model.
- **Preprocessing:** Cleaned and processed the data to handle missing values, outliers, and scaling.
- **Model Training:** Implemented various machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, to predict rainfall.
- **Evaluation:** Assessed model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² score.
- **Visualization:** Created visualizations to interpret the results and compare the models.
